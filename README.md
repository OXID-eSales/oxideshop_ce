###Getting involved

OXID eShop is available under two different licenses, GPLv3 and a commercial license.

That's why, before contributing for the first time, you must send the filled form "OXID eSales Contributor Agreement" 
(http://wiki.oxidforge.org/File:Oxid_esales_ca_v151.pdf) to community@oxid-esales.com. You can find more 
information about it on the FAQ page OXID Contribution and Contributor Agreement FAQ
http://wiki.oxidforge.org/OXID_Contribution_and_Contributor_Agreement_FAQ

Process:<br>
First off, you have to fork the repository OXID-eSales/oxideshop_ce to your list of repositories. 

You will find three branches now in youraccount/oxideshop_ce:

* <b>b-dev-ce</b>, presently our main branch on this repo, is the so called <b>feature branch</b>: All new features will be developed here as well as bug fixes for the next major version.
* <b>b-5.2-ce</b> is the <b>maintenance branch</b> for the present major version. Only bug fixes here, no new features, no DB changes, no template changes if possible.
* <b>b-5.1-ce</b> appears as the so called <b>legacy branch</b>: fixes for bugs with higher priority only.

In general, contributions can be taken over for all branches. Bug fixes committed to only one branch will be pushed to the other branches manually. Of course you can also consider to commit e.g. bug fixes to more than one branche.

<b>Best practice</b>: 
* please leave the the branch names as they are
* if you want to fix a bug or develop a new feature, define an own branch in your repository off of one of the three branches above. Name it e.g. feature/foo or bug/bugname for better tracability
* change whatever you want and push it back to the original branch (b-dev-ce).

Now you'll be asked for signing an OXID Contributor Agreement (this has to be done once). After that we can start checking your code. In every case, whether or not we could take your over your contribution, you'll be informed.
