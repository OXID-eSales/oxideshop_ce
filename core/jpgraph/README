* GD 2.28 or higher

Installation
------------
1. Make sure that the PHP version is compatible with the stated 
   requirements and that the PHP installation has support for 
   the GD library. Please run phpinfo() to check if GD library 
   is supported in the installation. 
   If the GD library doesn't seem to be installed 
   please consult the PHP manual under section "Image" for
   instructions on where to find this library. Please refer to
   the manual section "Verifying your PHP installation"
   
2. Unzip and copy the files to a directory of your choice where Your
   httpd sever can access them. 
   For a global site installation you should copy the files to 
   somewhere in the PHP search path. 
   It is recommended that only files in the stripped-src/ directory is
   copied to a production server since those files will be faster to parse
   due to the removal of white spaces and comments.

3. Check that the default directory paths in jpg-config.inc.php
   for cache directory and TTF directory suits your installation. 
   Note1: The default directories are different depending on if
   the library is running on Windows or UNIX.
   Note2: Apache/PHP must have write permission to your cache 
   directory if you enable the cache feature. By default the cache
   is disabled.
   

Documentation
-------------
The installation includes HTML documentation and reference guide for the
library. The portal page for all documentation is
<YOUR-INSTALLATION-DIRECTORY>/docportal/index.html


Troubleshooting
---------------
1. If an empty page is returned back when running an example check
   the following

      i) Make sure output_buffer is disabled in php.ini
     ii) Increase the maximum memory allowed by PHP (in php.ini) to at least
         32MB
    iii) Enable all error messages and notices in php.ini (error_reporting = E_ALL)

   Then try running the example again. Most likely an error message will
   now be shown that will give further information on what is wrong.
   For further clarifiction on the casues for the error messages see
   the FAQ section on the WEB site.

2. If you get an error message about "Illegal scale" make absolutely
   sure that the Zend PHP4 compatibility is turned off. This is done
   by setting "zend.ze1_compatibility_mode = Off" in php.ini

2. If you are running IIS and Win2k and get the error "Can't find
   font' when trying to use TTF fonts then try to change you paths
   to UNIX style, i.e. "/usr/local/fonts/ttf/". Remember that the
   path is absolute and not relative to the htdocs catalogue. Some 
   versions of GD for Windows also need you to set the environment
   variable GDFONTPATH for GD to find the fonts.

3. If you are using the cache please make sure that you have
   set the permissions correctly for the cache directory so that
   Apache/PHP can write to that directory.

4. Some windows installations seems to have a problem with a PHP
   script ending in a newline (This newline seems to be sent to the
   browser and will cause a Header already sent error). 
   If you have this problem try remove all trailing newlines in the
   jpgraph* files
